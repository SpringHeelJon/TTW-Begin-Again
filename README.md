﻿**[quote]## *Begin, Begin Again Tonight...*[/quote]**

Welcome to the Nexus home page for my new [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/) mod list Begin Again!

This page will serve as an installation guide and central mod repository for all the unique mods specific to the list.
It is also a good place to learn what the list is about and if it is for you.

Begin Again is a lightweight mod list that focuses on bringing the gameplay feel of later Fallout titles into Fallout 3 and New vegas. Whilst being careful to preserve what made those games unique. Built on top of the fantastic [Tale Of Two Wastelands](https://taleoftwowastelands.com/download_ttw) this modlist serves to expand on what they have acheived by modernising certain aspects of the game that have not aged well and slightly rebalancing things where needed. This mod list is NOT affiliated in anyway with the TTW team and should not be representative of their work. Please do not contact any members of the TTW team with queries about this list.

If you have never played Fallout 3 or even New Vegas before then this is designed to be the definitive experience for a player used to some of the features of more modern games.

Why the name? Well Begin Again is a [song](https://youtu.be/NCkwAgTcDBw) featured in the new vegas DLC "Dead Money". It has long been one of my favourite songs from the series and I feel the title is also a nod to the user about beginning the game again!

*[font=Verdana]## Begin Again Features:[/font]

**## [font=Verdana]Mod List[/font]

**Please see [here](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/begin-again) for a complete up to date list of all the mods Begin Again has.

**[font=Verdana]## What is Wabbajack?[/font]**

Due to the lack of sharing permissions for the vast majority of mods, traditional mod packs do not exist for Bethesda games. With Wabbajack it is possible to recreate one user’s mod list on another’s computer without redistributing any of the mod files. For more information, please check out the [Wabbajack website](https://www.wabbajack.org/) or join the official [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/wabbajack). Using Wabbajack is much easier than following a manual installation guide but it doesn’t absolve you from reading.


[font=Verdana]## **﻿Installing the list
**[/font]
Due to how Tale of Two Wastelands is installed and to comply with their terms of use you must follow the instructions shown below carefully. This mod list requires extra steps that you may not be familiar with even if you have used a Wabbajack list before.

[spoiler][font=Verdana]## **
**[/font]**[font=Verdana]## Setting up Begin Again with Wabbajack[/font]**

While Wabbajack takes care of 99% of the work, there are still some steps that need to be completed by the user. The Installation section will take you through the process from start to finish and you are expected to follow it to the letter. Begin Again requires:
* A copy of Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas with all official DLC  on Steam.
* A [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4) account, preferably with a Premium subscription.

**[font=Verdana]## Setting up MO2[/font]

**Mod Organizer 2 requires the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable and .NET Framework 4.8, two basic packages. Chances are you already have them installed, but please grab the two installers linked below and run them. If the packages are already present on your system, the installers should notify you.


* Download and install [Visual C++ 2019](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
* Download and install [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer).

If either of them were missing on your system, they will be installed now. Afterwards, you may be required to restart your PC.

**[font=Verdana]## Uninstallation[/font]

**In order to ensure that your Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 installation is pristine and vanilla, we are going to completely re-install the game. This is especially important if you have modded the game previously as left-over files might interfere with your  installation .If you never modded Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 and/or never installed other Wabbajack lists, you may skip this step. However, I still recommend you verify the game files through Steam in that case.


* Uninstall Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 through Steam
* Navigate to your Steam directory.
* If there is still a Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 folder there, delete it.

[quote]When uninstalling a game through Steam, only vanilla files are removed. Mod-added files must be deleted manually.[/quote]
**[font=Verdana]## INI Folder[/font]

**More Fallout-related files are located inside the so-called INI Folder which needs to be cleaned out as well. It contains your save games as well as the game’s INI files and, if you modded Fallout New Vegas before, NVSE plugin logs.
* Navigate to the INI Folder
* If you have an ongoing vanilla playthrough, back up the Saves folder.
* Delete everything inside the Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 folder.
**
[font=Verdana]## Reinstallation[/font]

**The reinstallation also serves the purpose of relocating the game files to a better directory. Using UAC protected folders for the game or any modding tools has a risk of causing issues down the line. It is best to avoid those folders to begin with. Most Wabbajack list authors, myself included, will not provide support for people that disregard this warning and use UAC protected folders anyway. Note that this does not include the Steam client. Additionally, Fallout New Vegas and Mod Organizer 2 should be installed on the same hard drive. Ideally that hard drive would be an SSD to reduce loading times and eliminate stuttering. 

**[font=Verdana]## Steam Library[/font]

**In order to prevent some confusion, I will refer to the Library in Steam as the Game Library. It is the second of four items in the top menu in the Steam client and contains a list of all your games. A Steam Library on the other hand is a folder on your hard drive into which Steam games are installed. Since we do not want to have files inside a UAC protected folder we should not install Fallout New Vegas in the default directory. A new Steam Library is required.

[quote]﻿Unfortunately Steam allows only one Steam Library per hard drive. You can find a workaround [here](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide).[/quote]

If you already have a separate Steam Library outside the UAC protected folders on the drive you want to install Fallout New Vegas and Mod Organizer 2 on, skip ahead to the next step. Otherwise follow the instructions below to create a new Steam Library:


* Open Steam and go into the Settings.
* In the Downloads tab, select Steam Library Folders.
* Click Add Library Folder.
* Point it to a location somewhere outside the UAC protected folders
* Close all windows when you’re done.

**[font=Verdana]## Setting the language to English[/font]

**Non-English installations of Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 are not supported.


* Right-click Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 in your Steam games library.
* Select Properties and switch to the Langauge tab.
* Ensure that the language is set to English.

**[font=Verdana]## Reinstalling the game
[/font]
**
* Open Steam and go into your Game Library.
* Find Fallout New Vegas in the list and click install.
* Find Fallout 3 in the list and click install.
* As location, select a Steam Library in a non-UAC protected folder and click Next.
* Wait for both games to be downloaded before you proceed.

**[font=Verdana]## Regenerating INI Files[/font]

**After re-installing the game, it is important to launch it at least once through Steam so that the registry keys are set up. Otherwise, certain modding tools may not recognise the game. Upon launching the game, the default set of INI files will also be regenerated.


* Find Fallout 3 in your Games Library and hit Play.
* You will be prompted with a notification that Fallout 3 is configuring your video options, click OK.
* Click OK again to the next window and hit Exit to close the launcher.
* Do the same for Fallout New Vegas.

[quote]﻿The preset that is selected now will be irrelevant. Begin Again uses its own set of INI files.[/quote]

The image shown is for Fallout 4 but the message will be identical.

**[font=Verdana]## Wabbajack Installation[/font]

**
* Download the [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/) executable from the official website.
* Move the downloaded file to a location of your choice.
* Double-click Wabbajack.exe. It will automatically download and install the latest version.
[font=Verdana]## 
[/font]**[font=Verdana]## Downloading Begin Again[/font]

**
* For now the Wabbajack file will be hosted here
* Download the file in the files section of this page
* Extract the folder somewhere on the same drive as your wabbajack install and steam directory.
* Double click the "begin again modlist" . Wabbajack file.
* On the screen that appears you will need to set your file paths.
The Begin Again folder:
* SHOULD be on your SSD or otherwise fastest hard drive.
* CANNOT be inside the Wabbajack installation folder.
* CANNOT be inside the Fallout New Vegas installation folder.
**
[font=Verdana]## Download Location[/font]

**The MO2 downloads folder within your Begin Again folder will automatically be chosen as the download location. However, this is mostly a waste of space as the downloaded mod archives are only required for the initial installation and subsequent updates but not for gameplay. I strongly recommend changing the Download Location to a folder on a hard drive with plenty of free storage.

[quote]You can reuse the download folders from different Wabbajack lists for the same game.[/quote]**
[font=Verdana]## Begin Again Installation[/font]

**After filling in the installation and download directories, click the Start button on the left. If you have Nexus Premium, you can lean back while Wabbajack downloads the required mod files and installs the setup. Otherwise, you will have to click through the mod pages and download manually (Wabbajack will guide you).

**[font=Verdana]## Mod Organizer 2[/font]**

## All mods are installed in Mod Organizer 2 which is required to play the setup. You must always launch NVSE through MO2.


* Navigate to your Begin Again installation directory.
* Double-click ModOrganizer.exe.

You will now be greeted by this screen:
[![https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/l637/Jon_Keatley/Screenshot_20230104_071612.png?width=1920&height=1080&fit=bounds](https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/l637/Jon_Keatley/Screenshot_20230104_071612.png?width=1920&height=1080&fit=bounds)](https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/l637/Jon_Keatley/Screenshot_20230104_071612.png?width=1920&height=1080&fit=bounds)

Minimise this screen for the moment. You will be needing it later!

From the [TTW Download](https://taleoftwowastelands.com/dl) page, download the 3.3.2 Installer file.


1. Extract the contents of the 3.3.2 Installer archive to a new folder called TTW Installer in a safe location outside of any default Windows folders.
1. Once everything has been extracted, open MO2, select the folder button at the top, and select Open Mods folder, and create a folder there named "[NoDelete] TTW 3.3.2" and move it to where its says "Tale of Two Wastelands Mod Here" Just above the hotfix file already there.
1. Back in the TTW Installer folder, right-click the TTW Install.exe and select Run As Administrator.
1. In the installer, verify that the automatically set file paths for both your Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas installations are correct.
1. Set the Tale of Two Wastelands install path to point to the folder ""[NoDelete] TTW 3.3.2" That you made earlier.
1. Start the installer going, this may take some time!
1. Once the installer has finished launch Mod Organizer 2, or if you kept it open, click the refresh button at the top to refresh the left pane.

1. If you installed TTW correctly with the correct file paths, you should now see this:

](https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/l637/Jon_Keatley/Screenshot_20230104_074150.png?width=1920&height=1080&fit=bounds)***Take care that the ESMs in blue are ticked and in the same order as the above.
***
That's it! Now all you have to do is click the "run" button top right and enjoy the list!

**## Controls and mod settings

**Begin Again aims to be familiar to those who have played later Fallout titles so I have made the control scheme for xbox controller players the same as Fallout 4. 

VATS is now on the left bumper with BASH on the right bumper
WAIT is still on the BACK button but now only functions when sitting like in Fallout 4
BACK when not sitting will now TOGGLE VIEW
GRAB and SNEAK are on the RIGHT THUMBSTICK CLICK
SPRINT is bound to the LEFT THUMBSTICK CLICK.

You can change any of these in game if you want to.

Many tweaks and options have been selected in the "Stewies tweaks" ini and I recommend you leave these alone.
