    "description": "Begin Again is a mod list that focuses on bringing the gameplay feel of later Fallout titles into Fallout 3 and New vegas. Whilst being careful to preserve what made those games unique. Built on top of the fantastic Tale Of Two Wastelands this modlist serves to expand on what they have achieved by modernising certain aspects of the game that have not aged well and slightly rebalancing things where needed. If you have never played Fallout 3 or even New Vegas before then this is designed to be the definitive experience for a player used to some of the features of more modern games.",
